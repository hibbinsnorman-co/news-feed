# msn-feed

This base project is produced based on claims made by [Microsoft] which I can not locate at present as the result I was going to reference from https://answers.microsoft.com is missing when I go back to cite sources...

The general idea was for this to be a template that added an iframe searching msn with a quesry based on the URL used by forks as github pages.

Almost like my actions are being monitored in realtime and the corporation has quickly removed an answer by a brand representative that legal doesn't agree with.

it may be pure coincidence.
